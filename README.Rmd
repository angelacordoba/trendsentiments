A package that analyses the sentiment Twitter users have about trending topics in
a country by using  [rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) package to pull
Twitter data and by using the function that finds the average sentiment of a variable
from [sentimentr](https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr). This README is based on 
Kurt Wirth's excellent [botscan](https://github.com/kurtawirth/botscan) 
documentation.

## Install

Install from GitHub with the following code:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("angelacordoba/trendsentiments")
```

This package connects <code>rtweet</code> to <code>sentimentr</code>. As a 
result, each user must have previously acquired authentication from Twitter and 
instructions to do that [can be found here](http://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html).

## Usage

Next time users start an R session on the same computer, rtweet should automatically
find their token. If they want to make sure it works, they can run the following 
code and check that the app name and the api_key match.

library(rtweet)

get_token()

Next, the entertainment begins with <code>trendsentiments</code>.

Its first and only argument takes the name of a country, in lowercase letters and
surrounded by quotation marks, that users want to see analyze the trends from.

The package will analyze 100 tweets from each of the top 5 trends of the selected 
country. If the user does not specify a country when using the function, the default
is to analyze the trends from the United States.

```{r usage, eval = FALSE}
## load trendsentiments
library(trendsentiments)

## Enter country surrounded by quotation marks
trendsentiments("canada")
#> [1]  trend               average_sentiment
#   1   #occupationhood     0.004160021
#   2   #TLMEP             -0.027170831
#   3   #90DayFiance       -0.005011163
#   4   #NationStarAc       0.068488918
#   5   #VWFC              -0.005308967
       

## Result is a table with the top 5 trends of Canada and their corresponding 
  #average sentiment based on tweets.

This process might take a couple of minutes while <code>trendsentiments</code>
streams tweets from the trends.

Twitter rate limits cap the number of Search results returned to 18,000 every 
15 minutes. Thus, excessive use of <code>trendsentiments</code> in a short amount of 
time may result in a warning and inability to pull results.  In this event, 
simply wait 15 minutes and try again. For more details visit [rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet).
